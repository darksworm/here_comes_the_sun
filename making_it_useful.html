<h1>III - Making it useful</h1>

<p>
  Now that the clock, relay and MOSFET are working, I'm ready to invest my time to make it actually useful. The first order of business is to hook up all of the LEDs, the proper PSU and MOSFETs.

  I had to add two DC-DC converters to lower the voltage for two of the three LED sets because earlier I found that the LEDs don't dim very well at 12V, but do at 8V. I added only two instead of three because I'm planning to use the third set as either fully off or fully on as the last step of the ramp up.

<p>
  I decided on having 3 settings:
  <ol>
    <li>Start time - when to start ramping up the brightness</li>
    <li>Ramp up time - interval; how long to ramp up from 0-100% brigtness</li>
    <li>End time - when to turn off</li>
  </ol>
  The start to end time interval is then split into two equal parts, one where the first low voltage LEDs ramp up to 100% and the other where the second does the same, while the first one is on at 100%. After that the high voltage LEDs turn on until the end time is reached when all of the LEDs are turned off. The ramp up code can be found <a href='https://github.com/darksworm/wake-up-light/blob/68f60d1a1ccc3263b059660acd8602c68a4925be/wul.ino#L415' target="_blank">here</a>.
