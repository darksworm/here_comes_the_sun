<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>
Waking up by alarm is unhealthy. Getting pulled out of sleep abruptly will make the body produce an excess of cortisol - the stress hormone. -- (check this info, expand)
</p>

<p>
  We've evoled to determine whether it's day or night by the amount of light. This is why staying in bright environments for prolonged periods and using your smart devices before bed has a negative impact on your sleep.
</p>

<p>
  I like my bedroom pitch dark when I go to sleep. That is why I've covered the windows with aluminum foil. This results in a consistent darkness every night which helps me fall asleep quicker.
</p>

pose problem here - how to wake up consistently and naturally.

<p>
  I've been waking up on my own, without an alarm clock for the past 6 months and its great, but sometimes I have to wake up earlier and I don't have a great way to do that.
</p>

<p>
  Waking up to the sun is most likely the best option as it is natural, but the problem is that the sun does not rise every day at the same time. Also clouds and surroudning buildings leave a great impact on the amount of light that gets through my bedroom window. So my solution is building an artificial sun.
</p>

<h1>The artificial sun</h1>

<p>I want something that can somewhat closely simulate the effect of the rise of the sun. 
  You can buy these pre-made, but i want to create my own for better flexibility.

  I want it to:
  <ul>
    <li>have a wide range of brightness</li>
    <li>generate a slow and gradual ramp-up of brightness</li>
    <li>be scheduable and automatic</li>
    <li>be wall-mountable</li>
    <li>be relatively cheap, < 50euros</li>
    <li>be extensible (to add more electronics to power on automatically in the future)</li>
    <li>be easy to maintain (no niche parts)</li>
    <li>be easy to turn off before heading to bed</li>
  </ul>

  In this project I'm purely focusing on the brightness aspect of the sun, I'll ignore the heating effect for now - that could be another project.
</p>

<h1>The how</h1>

<p>
  This project is going to be arduino powered.
