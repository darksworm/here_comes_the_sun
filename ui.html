<h1>V - The UI</h1>

<p>
  Now I'm ready to think about how the UI should work. To figure out what I need, I decided to first write user stories. I came up with these:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>I want to see the time</li>
  <li>I want to be able to change the start/mid/end times of the schedule</li>
  <li>I want to be able to disable the alarm</li>
  <li>When I change the start time, I want the other times to shift as well</li>
</ol>

<p>
  For changing the variables, it was clear that I need two views - one where I can choose the variable I want to change, another where I'm changing the variables. To change the variables I would want to either increment or decrement them. Looks like this can be done with 4 buttons.
</p>

<p>
  This is the rough flow I came up with.
</p>

<p>
  Fairly simple - two looping menu states with linear navigation and a temporary "displaying time" state.
</p>

<p>
  For the variable selection menu, I decided on this variable order:
  <ol>
    <li>Disable clock</li>
    <li>Start time</li>
    <li>Ramp-up time</li>
    <li>End time</li>
  </ol>
  I decided to leave the increment/decrement action logic for later.
</p>
