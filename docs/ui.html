<h1>V - Engineering the UI</h1>

<p>
  To figure out what the UI should do, I decided to start with writing user stories. I came up with these:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>I want to see the time</li>
  <li>I want to be able to change the start/mid/end times of the schedule</li>
  <li>I want to be able to disable the alarm</li>
  <li>When I change the start time, I want the other times to shift as well</li>
  <li>I want the clock to retain its settings even when unplugged</li>
</ol>

<p>
  To change the variables, it was clear two views/states are needed:
  <ul>
    <li>Selecting variable to change</li>
    <li>Changing selected variable</li> 
  </ul>To change the variables I would want to either increment or decrement them. Looks like this can be done with 4 buttons - increment, decrement, save, cancel.
</p>

<p>
  I came up with this weird combination of multiple UL diagrams (I've long forgotten how to do them properly, but this will do).
</p>

  TODO: update this, this is wrong - the displaying time should be latching and saving the value returns you to variable selection instead of changing variable.

  Rectangles are actions
  </br>
  Rectangles with rounded corners are states
  </br>
  Lines are either automatic transitions or button state induced transitions.
  </br>
</p>
<p>
Fairly simple - two looping menu states with linear navigation and a temporary "displaying time" state.
</p>

<p>
  I felt (mostly) comfortable about all of the actions I need to implement based on this diagram except for "Save value" - I didn't know how to even approach it, but after a quick search engine session, I found that the arduinos have an on-board <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEPROM' target='_blank'>EEPROM</a> and that it's not too difficult to use.
