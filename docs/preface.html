<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>
  Waking up by alarm is unhealthy. Getting pulled out of sleep abruptly will make the body produce an excess of cortisol - the stress hormone. -- (check this info, expand)
</p>

<p>
  We've evolved to determine whether it's day or night by the amount of visible light. This is why staying in bright environments for prolonged periods and using your smart devices before bed has a negative impact on sleep.
</p>

<p>
  I like my bedroom pitch dark when I go to sleep. That is why I've covered the windows with aluminum foil. This results in a consistent darkness every night which helps me fall asleep quicker.
</p>

<p>
  This does, however, mean that I am somewhat disconnected from the suns cycle - for ~8 hours each day, I am hidden away from it. I've been waking up on my own, without an alarm clock for the past 6 months quite consistently and its great, but sometimes I have to wake up earlier and my best solution so far is just an alarm clock which I do not llike using.
</p>

<p>
  Waking up to the sun is most likely the best option as it is natural, but the problem is that the sun does not rise every day at the same time. Also clouds and surrounding buildings leave a great impact on the amount of light that gets through my bedroom window. So it's obvious - I should build an artificial sun.
</p>

<h2>The artificial sun</h2>

<p>I want something that can somewhat closely simulate the effect of the rise of the sun. 
  This exists. This is a real product, you can get these on amazon or wherever. But I'm here to learn and want to create my own adapted-for-me and flexible version.

  I want it to:
  <ul>
    <li>have a wide range of brightness</li>
    <li>generate a slow and gradual ramp-up of brightness</li>
    <li>be scheduable and automatic</li>
    <li>be wall-mountable</li>
    <li>be relatively cheap, < 50euros</li>
    <li>be extensible (to add more electronics to power on automatically in the future)</li>
    <li>be easy to maintain (no niche parts)</li>
    <li>be easy to turn off before heading to bed</li>
  </ul>

  In this project I'm purely focusing on the brightness aspect of the sun, I'll ignore the heating effect for now - that could be another project.
</p>

<h2>The how</h2>

<p>
  This project is going to be arduino powered. I've been aching to get into arduino for quite some time and this seems like the perfect first project.
</p>
</p>
I'll be using a DS3231 clock module for the scheduling and MOSFETs for PWM brightness control of the LEDs. All of these parts can be ordered on ebay. 
</p>
<p>
  I am currently not planning further than creating the first prototype as I've no idea what will work and what won't. I'll be approaching this project similary to how I approach software development - build protypes quickly, adapt as you go and polish only when you've found a model that works. I know very little about electronics, so I'll be learning as I go and expect many challenges to arise along the way.
