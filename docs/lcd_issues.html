<h1>VII - LCD noise issues</h1>

<p>
  During testing, an issue arose. Sometimes when turning the lights on or off, the LCD would start outputing gibberish.

  I also noticed that turning the lights on severely impacted the brightness and color of the characters on the LCD.

  It looks like the relay is drawing too much power. This is not a surprise - the arduino uno is rated to output max 200 mA and each relay draws 120 mA. I quicky fixed this by using one relay instead of two. This did solve the character brighness issue, but the LCD would still get garbled at times.

  I tried hooking up the relay to a separate power source (as it is recommended to do so) but the issue was still present, although a lot less common. For the time being, the best solution I could come up with was removing the relay and powering the arduino from the 12V PSU. This fixes the issue, but means more idle power draw.

    I am not thrilled about having the 12V PSU connected at all times, but I don't see a better alternative at this point. I ordered an I2C module for the LCD in the hopes that having a serial connection between the arduino and LCD would fix these issues as the RTC seems to be unaffected by the relay.
